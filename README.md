DIY Baseboard Thermostat for 220VAC Electrical Heater.

This project turns your 240 VAC electric baseboard heater to a smart baseboard heater that allows you to:

- Set up a temperature sensor far away from the heater allowing for a more representative temperature measurement for the room.
- Control the baseboard heaterâ€™s temperature from Google Home, Alexa, via Home Assistant.
- Monitor power consumption.

# FAQ

## How do I determine how much power my baseboard heater draws?

Source: [https://www.gcea.coop/energy-efficiency/energy-evaluations/baseboard-heater-information/#:~:text=Baseboard heaters typically use 250,watts (250 times 6)](https://www.gcea.coop/energy-efficiency/energy-evaluations/baseboard-heater-information/#:~:text=Baseboard%20heaters%20typically%20use%20250,watts%20(250%20times%206)).

You can try multiplying the feet the baseboard heaters length by 250 to get a rough idea. I would add 25% to be very sure. You could also use a clamp power meter to find out how much power the baseboard heater circuit is drawing and multiply the voltage to get Watts.
